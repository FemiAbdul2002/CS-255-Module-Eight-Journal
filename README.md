Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is about creating a system for a client named DriverPass, who wants a system to manage driver training. The system will help driving schools keep track of student progress, schedule lessons, and conduct evaluations. Our consulting company will use a mix of object and process modeling methods to design the system. This approach combines the best parts of both methods for a smart design. We'll make a document with diagrams to show how the system will work and list the technical things needed for the system to be built. We're also making a simple presentation for the client to explain how different parts of the system will meet their needs. We'll keep the presentation free of technical terms so the client can easily understand.
What did you do particularly well?
In the DriverPass project, I did a great job understanding what the client needed for their driver training system. I suggested a smart way to design the system using two different methods. I wrote a clear document that explained everything the client wanted. I also explained technical things in an easy way, which will help when I talk to the client. Mixing technical skills with simple explanations is something I did really well.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to pick one part of my work on these documents to revise, I might focus on enhancing the visual clarity of the UML diagrams in the system design document. To improve them, I would aim to make the diagrams even more intuitive by simplifying complex relationships and ensuring that they accurately reflect the system's components and interactions. This would involve using clearer labels, arranging elements logically, and possibly adding more explanatory notes where needed. By doing so, the diagrams would effectively convey the system's structure to both the project lead and the development team, ensuring smoother implementation and clearer understanding.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I understood what the users wanted and incorporated their needs into my system design. This is crucial because by considering the users' needs, I ensure that the system is user-friendly and does what they actually require. If I overlook the users' needs, the system might end up being confusing or ineffective. So, thinking about the users' needs is absolutely essential to create a well-designed system.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by understanding what's needed, explaining the software's goals, making it user-friendly, creating an initial version for testing, and planning how all the parts fit together. In the future, I'll use different methods like understanding needs, making things easy for users, trying out prototypes, using pictures to plan, breaking things into parts, testing well, getting feedback to improve, writing down decisions, working with others, thinking about growth, checking for problems, testing with users, and learning new things to design systems better.
